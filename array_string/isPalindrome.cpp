/*
 * Question:  
 * Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering 
 * only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. For example,  
 * "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome. "race a car" 
 * is not a palindrome.  
 * Example Questions Candidate Might Ask:  
 * Q: What about an empty string? Is it a valid palindrome?  
 * A: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid 
 * palindrome.  
 */
/*
 * Solution:  O(n) runtime, O(1) space:  The idea is simple, have two 
 * pointers â€“ one at the head while the other one at the tail. Move 
 * them towards each other until they meet while skipping non-alphanumeric 
 * characters.  Consider the case where given string contains only 
 * non-alphanumeric characters. This is a valid palindrome because the 
 * empty string is also a valid palindrome.
